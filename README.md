# Project Overview

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all researchers and the open-source community for their support. The software field continually faces challenges related to maintenance and compatibility. Despite the availability of many valuable code resources, some classic codes are gradually phased out due to a lack of ongoing maintenance. Although every learner must inevitably go through the process of environment configuration, we aim to minimize the associated hassles as much as possible.

## Declaration

This project does not modify the business code in the original repository; it only updates the environment configuration. The project respects all software copyrights of the original authors.

## Common Issues in Environment Configuration

- **Dependency Conflicts:** Some packages in the requirements file do not explicitly specify versions, which may lead to dependency conflicts as versions update. While traditional tools like dependabot and renovate can help developers update to the latest dependencies, the latest libraries do not necessarily guarantee stable operation. Our goal is a working environment.
- **Model Compatibility Issues:** Some model checkpoints have compatibility problems, affecting the normal operation of the code.

## Project Objectives

This project aims to:

- Fix the aforementioned dependency issues and migrate the related code to the Colab environment to reduce the complexity of environment configuration.
- Acknowledge that all software has a lifecycle; if a piece of software cannot run, it should be properly marked as needing maintenance.

## Solutions

To achieve these goals, we propose the following methods (which can be used individually or in combination):

- **Explicitly Specify Dependency Versions:** Clearly specify the version of each package in the requirements file to ensure environment stability.
- **Utilize Python uv Tool:** Use the Python uv tool for automatic environment configuration and management.
- **Adopt Docker Technology:** Use Docker to package the entire environment, ensuring consistent code operation across any platform.
